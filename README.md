# AWS EKS Auto Mode Terraform demo

This repo provides the terraform files to deploy a demo app running on an AWS EKS Cluster with Auto Mode _enabled_, using best practices.

To learn more about AWSK EKS Auto Mode see the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/automode.html).

In these Terraform files, comments describe how AWS EKS Auto Mode simplifies and changes deployment. You can search for `EKS Auto Mode` to find these comments.

## Deployed resources

This Terraform configuration deploys the following resources:
* AWS EKS Cluster with Auto Mode _enabled_, using Amazon EC2 nodes
* Amazon DynamoDB table
* Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume used as attached storage for the Kubernetes cluster (a `PersistentVolume`)
* Demo "guestbook" application, deployed via containers
* Application Load Balancer (ALB), which you can use to access the app

Plus several other supporting resources, as shown in the following diagram:

## How to use

### Option 1. For those familiar with using Terraform
1. Update the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table used for Terraform backend state here: [backend.tf](terraform/backend.tf). Instructions are in the comments in that file.
1. Choose one of the `tfvars` configuration files in the [terraform/environment](terraform/environment) directory, or create a new one. The environment name `env_name` should be unique to each `tfvars` configuration file. You can also set the AWS Region in the configuration file.
1. `cd` into the `terraform` directory
1. Run `terraform init`
1. Set the terraform workspace to the same value as the environment name `env_name` for the `tfvars` configuration file you are using.
  1. If this is your first time running then use `terraform workspace new <env_name>`
  1. On subsequent uses use `terraform workspace select <env_name>`
1. Run `terraform plan -var-file=environment/<selected tfvars file>`
1. Run `terraform apply -var-file=environment/<selected tfvars file>`

Under **Outputs** may be listed a value for `alb_dns_name`. If not, then 
* you can wait a few minutes and re-run the `terraform apply` command, or
* you can look up the value in your EKS cluster by examnining the `Ingress` Kubernetes resource

Use this DNS name to access the app.  Use `https:\\` (do _not_ use https).

If you want to experiment and make changes to the Terraform, you should be able to start at step 3.

### Option 2. Automatic configuration and execution
